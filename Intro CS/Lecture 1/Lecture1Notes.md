# Types of Knowledge

- Declarative knowledge is statement of fact
  \*Imperative knowledge is a recipe of "how to"

- Programming is about writing recipes to generate facts

# Numerical Example

- Square root of a number _x_ is _y_ such that _y \* y = x_

* Start with a _guess_, _g_:
  1. If _g \* g_ is close enough to _x_, stop and say _g_ is the answer
  2. Otherwise make a new guess by averaging _g_ and _x/g_
  3. Using the new guess, repeat process until close enough

## We have an Algorithm:

1. Sequence of simple steps
2. Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
3. A means of determining when to stop

> Algorithms are recipes / recipes are Algorithms

# Computers are Machines that execute Algorithms

- Two things computers do:

  - Performs simple operations 100s of billions per second !
  - Remembers results

- What kinds of calculations ?

  - Built-in to the machine, e.g., +, -,
  - Ones that you define as the programmer

- The Big Idea here ?

  - A computer will only do what you tell it to do

- Fixed program computer
  - Fixed set of algorithms
  - What we had until 1940's
- Stored program computer computer
  - Machines stores and executes instructions
- Key insight: Programs are no different from other kinds of data

### Stored program computer:
